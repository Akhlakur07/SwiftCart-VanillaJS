<h2>1) What is the difference between null and undefined?</h2>
   <p>Undefined means a variable has no value yet.</br>
   Null means the value is empty on purpose.</p>

<h2>2) What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()?</h2>
   <p>map() creates and returns a new array.</br>
   forEach() just loops through the array and does not return anything.</p>

<h2>3) What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
   <p>== compares values only.</br>
   === compares value and type.</p>

<h2>4) What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data?</h2>
   <p>It waits for API data and makes code easier to read.</p>

<h2>5) Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block).</h2>
   <p>Scope means where a variable can be used.</br>
   Global = everywhere.</br>
   Function = inside a function.</br>
   Block = inside { } only.</p>
